Front-End code assessment

Technical Notes:

- The Footer, Header and Content were not separated in component and container, since they did not present a representative complexity.

- It was decided not to use data-test as a search engine to verify if, in the unit test, the component was correctly rendered. On the other hand, being a simple and single-programmer application, it was decided to search by the name of the class
